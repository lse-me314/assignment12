The assignment Rmd file is [here](https://github.com/lse-me314/assignment11/blob/master/me314-assignment11-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME.Rmd). Note that this file will not compile for you if you just download it on its own because it calls in some image files that are hosted in the github repo. Feel free to delete the lines in the Rmarkdown to get rid of the images while you are working!

It may be easier to work from the html version of the assignment, which can be found [here](me314-assignment11-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME.html).
